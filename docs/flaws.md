# Flaws and ideas

What working with the kit in its consumers (the BotEco panel, Cursio, the
launcher) turned up and is not fixed yet, and what would make it stronger.
Each entry says where it showed, what goes wrong and what the fix is. A fixed
entry is deleted, not ticked: the commit says what changed.

## Flaws

- **LpContextMenu and LpHoverCard cannot wrap each other.** Both render a
  fragment, and an `as-child` trigger cannot take a fragment, so a row with a
  menu and a card needs a wrapping element (LpSidebarRow, LpColorPicker carry
  one). Let one of them forward `as-child` to its own trigger, or offer an
  element root.
- **Kit props are loose in consumers.** A misspelt prop (`text` for
  `content` on LpTooltip, `categories` for `labels` on LpChart) falls through
  as an attribute with no error, and vue-tsc in the app does not catch it.
  Ship prop types consumers check, or warn in dev on an unknown prop of a kit
  component.

- **Forward onto an overlay entry is a router visit.** With overlay history
  on, Back from a kit entry mutes the router, but Forward starts from the
  router's own entry, so vue-router runs its guards and `afterEach` for the
  page it is already on (nothing remounts). Engines differ on listener order
  on `window`, so the kit cannot stop that pop before the router sees it.
  Marking the router's entry as well would let the kit mute it there too,
  but Back from that entry to an earlier page would then reach the router
  replayed, with its scroll key off by one.

- **`patterns.pw.ts` › "loading example reserves the content and action
  geometry" fails on CI now and then:** the action button is caught at x 16
  instead of 707 for one read, then the rerun passes. It failed on both the
  v0.77.0 and v0.77.1 runs and never locally against the preview. Likely the
  button is measured mid-mount of the example frame, before the row lays out.

## Ideas

- **Context switcher in the rail header**: server, workspace or machine, which
  every app now draws in the header slot itself.
- **Reorder pins** by dragging within the pinned block, and pin by dragging a
  row into it.
- **Call the viewer back to a hidden tab** (`useAttention`): a system
  notification when permission is granted plus a flashing tab title until the
  tab regains focus, nothing while it is focused. BotEco's panel has it as
  `lib/attention.ts` for a resumed quiz; any app with a live wait wants it.
